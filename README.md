# Industry-project

This project is challenge for collaboratively working with BrainStation discipline to come up with an advertsing focussed entirely on content creators in collaboration with Electronic Arts. The Web developemtn was entirely built in `React JS`.

## Challenge

A Collaboration among the different discipline of BrainStation, UX Desginers, Data Scientist and Web Developer, where each team gives their output for a website laid out as a challenge by the educators.

Each discipline provided their own unique skills to successfully implement the website we see here.

The Data Scientist team provided the data and research websites required for a general scope of the project and where each data can be sourced to. What is the general perspective of clients and what information does a user look for in regards to content creation.

The UX Designers team provided a general layout as well as an identity to the project, Here we see a streamer `SallyStreamer` as our main protagonist. She is a content creator who makes profits by showcasing her video game skills and her interest lie in playing games `Apex Legend, Fifa 2023, The Sims and BattleField` The Interface allows her to stream her content on multiple platform as well provide her with a website that shows her profits in real time.

I as part of the Web Developer team built the website that was designed by the UX designers. The website uses modules of `SASS,` `react-router-dom` and `useStates`.
